###Delete Items By DocumentKey
```Main.py``` is a script which extracts rows from a .csv file and deletes all items listed according to their documentKey values. 
The script will produce two output files: 
  - deleted_items.json lists all items that have been successfully deleted. 
  - ignored_items.json lists all items that have been ignored by the script. 

Items with names in the .csv file that do not match the name of the item retrieved by the API will be ignored by the script. 

Please note that this script is distrubuted as-is as an example and will likely require modification to work for your specific use-case.  This example omits error checking. Jama Support will not assist with the use or modification of the script.

### Before you begin
